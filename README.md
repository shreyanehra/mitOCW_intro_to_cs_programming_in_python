# MIT OCW: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

Welcome to my repository for solutions to the problem sets from the [MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) course: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to computer science and programming using the Python language. The primary aim is to teach students how to think computationally and to write programs to solve useful problems. This is the first part of a two-course sequence.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem sets. Each problem set is in its own directory and contains my solutions to the problems given in the course.


## Problem Sets

1. **Problem Set 1**: Basics of Python programming including simple operations, conditionals, and loops.
2. **Problem Set 2**: More advanced programming constructs including functions and recursion.
3. **Problem Set 3**: Introduction to data structures such as lists and dictionaries.
4. **Problem Set 4**: File I/O and handling exceptions.
5. **Problem Set 5**: Object-oriented programming and classes.
6. **Problem Set 6**: Algorithmic problem solving including search and sort algorithms.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mit-ocw-python-solutions.git
    cd mitOCW_intro_to_cs_programming_in_python
    ```

2. **Navigate to a Problem Set Directory**: 
    ```sh
    cd ps1
    ```

3. **Run the Solutions**: 
    You can run the Python scripts using the following command:
    ```sh
    python ps1a.py
    ```

## Requirements

- I used Python 3.11 and Spyder


Happy coding!
